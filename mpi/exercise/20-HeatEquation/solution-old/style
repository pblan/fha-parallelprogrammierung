 `plot` is the primary command for drawing plots with `gnuplot`.  It creates
 plots of functions and data in many, many ways.  `plot` is used to draw 2-d
 functions and data; `splot` draws 2-d projections of 3-d surfaces and data.
 `plot` and `splot` contain many common features; see `splot` for differences.
 Note specifically that although the `binary <binary list>` variation does
 work for both `plot` and `splot`, there are small differences between these
 modes.  Furthermore, `plot`'s `axes` option does not exist for `splot`.

 Syntax:
       plot {<ranges>}
            {<function> | {"<datafile>" {datafile-modifiers}}}
            {axes <axes>} {<title-spec>} {with <style>}
            {, {definitions,} <function> ...}

 where either a <function> or the name of a data file enclosed in quotes is
 supplied.  A function is a mathematical expression or a pair of mathematical
 expressions in parametric mode.  The expressions may be defined completely or
 in part earlier in the stream of `gnuplot` commands (see `user-defined`).

 It is also possible to define functions and parameters on the `plot` command
 itself.  This is done merely by isolating them from other items with commas.

 There are four possible sets of axes available; the keyword <axes> is used to
 select the axes for which a particular line should be scaled.  `x1y1` refers
 to the axes on the bottom and left; `x2y2` to those on the top and right;
 `x1y2` to those on the bottom and right; and `x2y1` to those on the top and
 left.  Ranges specified on the `plot` command apply only to the first set of
 axes (bottom left).

 Examples:
       plot sin(x)
       plot f(x) = sin(x*a), a = .2, f(x), a = .4, f(x)
       plot [t=1:10] [-pi:pi*2] tan(t), \
            "data.1" using (tan($2)):($3/$4) smooth csplines \
                     axes x1y2 notitle with lines 5
